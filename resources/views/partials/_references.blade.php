She is highly talented and committed to staying on top of the latest in new languages and web dev techniques. There is very little she can't do, but if she can't do it she will find out how to do it fast. Jeimi is great to work with and its hard for people not to like her immediately. I fully recommend her, and she totally earns it."

She constantly steps back from a design and questions if this is a clear and natural way for user to interact with the system and is always adapting to make the best changes from that perspective.

                                            Jeimi's knowledge of both front and back end design is invaluable when it comes to project designs, as she keeps both perspectives in mind and can limit the amount of redesign on the UI for long projects."

                                            Your menuing idea solved about 20 different issues.  It was the last real missing piece and the solution you came up with is exceptional.  I showed it to my wife who works for Oracle and has a team of 30 developers and 15 UI designers under her.  She was really impressed (and that is not an easy thing to do).  Great work!!
